CamPhish: What is it?
CamPhish is the practice of taking pictures of the target's PC webcam or phone's front camera. CamPhish uses a built-in PHP server to host a phony website and uses ngrok and serveo to create a URL that we provide to the target so they can access it online. This tool takes screenshots of the target's device when the website requests camera access.

This tool's features include two automatic webpage templates that I built for engaged targets to obtain further cam images.
